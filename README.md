# A simple kids game

This game was made to help my children to recognize words.
It will be updated untill i feel that it is working as intended.
With that said, its built for them to learn Swedish, but english could probably be easily added.

This game is currenty unplayable as its only the base frame for the game that is available.

**ToDo list for project**

- Refactor the CSS file to be more organized, less duplicate code.
- make timer work on "Game start".
- make wordlist with Swedish 3 letter words.
- make audio files for atleast 3 rounds of gameplay.


**A bit later list**

- Make a flask app to host the service and handle the game logic
- Make 2 more game modes for harder difficulties.

**Make a lot later list**

- Dockerize the app so people can run it straight in a Docker container.
- Probably some more stupid ideas that will eat time :)
