# A simple kids game

This game was made to help my children to recognize words.
It will be updated untill i feel that it is working as intended.
With that said, its built for them to learn Swedish, but english could probably be easily added.

This game is currenty unplayable as its only the base frame for the game that is available.

**ToDo list for project**

- make timer work on game start.
- make wordlist with Swedish 3 letter words.
- make audio files for atleast 3 rounds of gameplay.
